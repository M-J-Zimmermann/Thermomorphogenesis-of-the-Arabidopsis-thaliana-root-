Data and scripts from the paper 'Thermomorphogenesis of the Arabidopsis thaliana root: Flexible cell division, constrained elongation, and the role of cryptochrome'. The 
'Cell_production_assay_all_data.csv' file contains all data from the cell production assay experiment. The root growth rate for the final day of growth, the cell length for the 
final day of growth, and the cell production rate calculated from the root growth rate and cell length. Includes data for each individual plant. Also includes the number of
lateral roots for certain genotypes. The 'Stripflow_output_from_curvefitting.csv' file contains all data from the Stripflow experiments detailed in the paper. This is the data
obtained after curvefitting the velocity profile outputs from Stripflow. It includes the meristem length, growth zone length, elongation zone length, and elemental elongation 
rates for each individual root. The 'timelapseimaging.bsh' is the script used to capture images set 60 seconds apart for Stripflow.
